# Factorio Space Exploration (SE) Setup

## Setting up the mods

Factorio doesn't allow sharing modlits easily, but youy can "sync-up" to a save file. That's what we'll do to get your mods ready.

1. Go to your factorio folder `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Factorio`
2. In the `mods` folder, if there's already a mod-list.json file, rename it to mod-list-backup.json
3. Take the provided save, "Factorio SE Mod sync.zip", and drop it in the factorio `saves` folder.
4. Boot Up factorio normally.
5. In the game, follow the following menus
   _Single Player_ > _Load Game_ > _Factorio SE Mod Sync_ > _Load_ > _Sync Mods and load_
   - Uncheck _Load save after sync_
   - Click _Confirm_
   - Wait for downloads
